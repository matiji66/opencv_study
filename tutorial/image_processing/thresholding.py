    In global thresholding, we used an arbitrary value for threshold value,
    right? So, how can we know a value we selected is good or not? Answer is,
    trial and error method. But consider a bimodal image (In simple words,
    bimodal image is an image whose histogram has two peaks). For that image,
    we can approximately take a value in the middle of those peaks as threshold
    value, right ? That is what Otsu binarization does. So in simple words, it
    automatically calculates a threshold value from image histogram for a bimodal image. (For images which are not bimodal, binarization wonâ€™t be accurate.)
