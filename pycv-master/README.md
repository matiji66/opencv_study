## Learning OpenCV 3 with Python - Second Edition

This is the repository and reference website for [Learning OpenCV 3 with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-opencv-3-computer-vision-python-second-edition), a book authored by [Joe Minichino](https://github.com/techfort) and [Joe Howse](https://github.com/JoeHowse)

### Code
Code is divided in chapters reflecting the samples contained in the book, feel free to report errors either by:
* opening an issue on github
* contacting the author directly (if you don't have a github account)

Github is my preferred way as it grants visibility to all issues reported.

### Virtual Machine
I created a VM for VirtualBox which allows you to skip installation steps and jump straight into action. However, I am yet to find a free storage service where to upload the 12GB file to make it freely availalble. This is currently being addressed so check to this page constantly.
